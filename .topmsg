Subject: [PATCH] Add function to refine a track from routing service

This patch add a menu entry for track/route in order to request a
refined version of the track/route.

The user is now able to plan a journey by creating a simple track/route
and then request a routing engine to refine this track/route.
This is a simple solution to extend route finder tool, adding 'via'
points in the journey.
