Subject: [PATCH] Add a tab in the Track property window

This patch moves all editable properties of a track/route to a
dedicated tab. It seems better to distinguish editable properties
and computed properties (called Statistics).

TODO: fix how widgets are distributed horizontally in the "Properties"
tab.
